# *** This htaccess file has been modified automatically on November 16, 2020 ***
# Due to the end-of-life of SLC6 and Apache 2.2, web sites get migrated to a new infrastructure running
# CC7 and Apache 2.4. There are incompatible differences in web site configuration between these two versions.
# Because this htaccess file contained such incompatibilities, it has been modified in a way that works on both
# old and new infrastructures during the transition period (October-November 2020).
# See https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal/?id=outage&n=OTG0059516
#
# *** If you need to modify this file during the transition period, make sure to apply your changes to both sections
# below. The site owner received an email with instructions to validate the web site configuration in the new
# infrastructure. ***
